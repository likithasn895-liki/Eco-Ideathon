# Overlay Artefacts – Rooftop Solar Detection

This folder contains visual output artefacts generated by our rooftop solar
verification pipeline for the PM Surya Ghar Yojana use case.

## What these images show
Each image is a satellite rooftop image with:
- Detected solar panel regions highlighted using bounding boxes / masks
- Sample ID mentioned in the filename
- Output generated after model inference

## Naming Convention
IMG_<sample_id>_overlay.jpg

Example:
- IMG_001_overlay.jpg
- IMG_002_overlay.jpg

## How these images were generated
1. Satellite images were processed using a trained computer vision model
2. The model predicts presence and area of rooftop solar panels
3. OpenCV was used to draw visual overlays on detected regions
4. Final overlay images were saved in this folder

## Usage
These artefacts are intended for:
- Visual verification of solar panel detection
- Supporting evidence for automated rooftop solar verification

## Notes
- Only generated output images are stored here
- Raw satellite images are not included in this folder
